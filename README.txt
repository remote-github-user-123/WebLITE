Weblite is a simple and fully functional online code editor for HTML, CSS and JS that provides an interface for generating output on the fly. It provides an environment that can be used for quickly testing out markup and styles without much hassle and is pretty straightforward to use. The webpage essentially consists of separate text editors for HTML , CSS and JS which the user can switch between as he/she codes. The output gets periodically regenerated based on user activity.
